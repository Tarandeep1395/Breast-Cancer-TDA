# Breast-Cancer-TDA
Implementation of topological data analysis as a means for explainable machine learning in neural networks
The dataset chosen for the project is breast cancer binary classification provided by the UCI repository. 
The project is focused towards showing topological data analysis techniques such as persistent homology, 
Mapper algorithm and Umap on an artificial neural network.

In addition, the project showcases traditional explainable machine learning techniques of Partial Dependenc Plots, 
Individual Conditional Expectations and SHAP values implemented over a random forest algorithm.
